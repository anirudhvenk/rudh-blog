Pork ribs are one of the most simple yet delicious dishes I know of. The smokiness of the meat combined with the flavor and intensity of barbecue sauce not only satisfies you to the last bite, but keeps you wanting more. Therefore, it is only fitting to talk about this iconic staple of true American cuisine.

### History

The history of ribs could not be complete without mentioning how and when pigs arrived in the Americas. On the insistence of Queen Isabella, Christopher Columbus brought pigs along on his voyage to Cuba in 1493. However, Hernando de Soto landed in Tampa Bay, FL in 1539 with America’s first 13 pigs. In just about three years the flock grew to over 700 pigs, both domesticated and wild! Since that time and throughout U.S. history, BBQ pork ribs have become the quintessential American food.

### Baby Back Ribs

Baby back ribs come from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of the pig’s rib cage. A rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs but can include up to 13 ribs.

### Spare Ribs

Spare ribs are taken from the belly side of the rib cage, below the section of back ribs and above the breastbone. They are flatter and contain more bone than meat, but more fat which makes the ribs more tender than back ribs. The shape is almost rectangular.

### Rib Tips

Rib tips are short, meaty sections of rib attached to the lower end of the spare ribs, between the ribs and the sternum. These do not contain bone and are cut away from the spare ribs.

### Riblets

Butchers create riblets by taking a full set of spare ribs and cutting them in half. It produces a set of short, flat ribs with a uniform shape and size. Although once considered a waste product, riblets have become popular for their excellent flavor and lower cost.

### The Science Behind a Perfect Rib

Since ribs are a pretty commonly used muscle for pigs, they contain a lot of meat in addition to connective tissue. However the layer of fat which protects it give the ribs the soft, silky taste they are known for.

## Recipe and Directions

### Ribs

- 2 to 2 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs
- Salt and black pepper

### Sweet and Spicy Barbecue Sauce 

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 cup finely diced onion
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 cup ketchup, try our homemade ketchup recipe
- 1 tablespoon hot chili sauce (suggestion Sriracha)
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- Salt and ground pepper, to taste

### Prepare Ribs

1. Heat oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135C).
2. If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.
3.Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper then place, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half in order for them to fit into the pan).
4. Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 3 to 4 hours.

### Make Barbecue Sauce

5. While the ribs bake, make the barbecue sauce. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
6. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the cumin and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
7. Add the ketchup, hot chili sauce, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine, season with salt then cook for 2 minutes. Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.

### To Finish

Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.
