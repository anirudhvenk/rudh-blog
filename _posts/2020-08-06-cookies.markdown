This recipe for cookies isnâ€™t just any cookie recipe. This is the iconic Doubletree Hotel nutty, rich, chocolatey oatmeal cookie, which Hilton has been serving to guests for over 25 years. And just recently, they released the highly coveted recipe for the public to enjoy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<h3>Where Did It All Begin?</h3>

In 1980, a select number of Doubletree hotels began serving cookies to VIP guests; however, in 1986, the secret recipe was developed so every hotel could offer the same sweet treat.

Oatmeal cookies, on the other hand, have been around for quite some time. They originated from Scottish/British oatcakes, and were primarily carried by soldiers for boosts of energy during battle. In 1896, the first American recipe for oatmeal cookies was documented by Fannie Merritt Farmer. 

<h3>The Science Behind the Perfect Cookie</h3>

<h4>Flour</h4>

Depending on its ratio to other ingredients in the dough, flour makes cookies chewy or crisp or crumbly. In dry cookie dough, like shortbread, a high proportion of flour to the small amount of liquid in the butter produces a tender, crumbly texture. Cookies that need to hold their shape during baking, like biscotti or pinwheel cookies, also have a high ratio of flour. In fluid-batter cookies like brownies, a lower proportion of flour to the amount of liquid or egg results in a cakey or chewy texture.

<h4>Sugar</h4>

Aside from adding sweetness, granulated white sugar makes cookies browner (by caramelizing) and crisper (by absorbing moisture in the dough). It also encourages spreading as the sugar melts. The proportion of sugar in most cookie dough recipes is so high that only about half of the sugar dissolves during mixing. During baking more of the sugar dissolves, which causes the dough to soften and spread. For the best results, use pure cane sugar because products that contain both beet and cane sugars tend to be less consistent in quality.

<h4>Fat</h4>

Shortening and butter make cookies tender. When mixed into flour, fat coats some of the flour and protects it from the liquid in some recipes. This prevents gluten from developing, making the cookies more tender and less chewy.

## Recipe and Directions

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature
- 3/4 cup + 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp lemon juice
- 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 2/3 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
- 1 3/4 cups chopped walnuts

1. Preheat oven to 300F. Line a baking sheet (s) with parchment paper
2. Cream the soft butter, and both sugars in a stand mixer for 2 minutes until light and fluffy, Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. You can use electric hand beaters if you like.
3. Beat in the eggs, vanilla, and lemon juice. Beat for 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed.
4. Lower the speed and blend in the flour, oats, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.
5. Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts, making sure to get them evenly distributed.
6. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop out the dough (3 tablespoon amounts) and place 2 inches apart on your lined cookie sheets. I flatten the balls slightly. Bake for 20-23 minutes until starting to turn golden. I found that 20 minutes worked for me.
7. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 15 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
