Because of our family’s love for cooking as well as the unusual circumstances of COVID-19, we decided to embark on a “Chopped” challenge, in which we only use select ingredients to create a delicious dish in only a week. The week’s main ingredients were cheese, cilantro, and nuts.

### The Dishes

Tasked with the cheese dish, I decided to make a sort of paneer kebab (paneer being made out of cottage cheese). The goal was to place blocks of paneer and red bell peppers onto a skewer and grill them with a mint glaze on top.

My sister, on the other hand, decided to make baklava, a famous greek dish made of extremely thin layers of filo dough and syrup and served with crushed pistachios on top.

### History

Modern paneer is usually traced back to the Persian and Afghan rulers who introduced it in the 16th century, primarily in North India, where it was made with either goat or sheep rennet. The term “paneer” comes from the word “peynir,” which just means “cheese” in the Turkish and Persian Languages.

Today’s method of making paneer, which involves “breaking” milk with an acid like lemon juice, may have been introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal in the 17th century – and this is when cheeses like paneer and chhena first entered their modern forms.

As for baklava, the history of this scrumptious delicacy is quite controversial, and unfortunately not very well documented. Many ethnic groups such as the Greek, Turkish and Middle Easterners claim baklava as their own, and prepare it in their own ways.

The story of baklava began long long ago, as a matter of fact one version of the story claims that Baklava origins to the mighty Assyrians, who had been preparing it ancient-assyria as early as the 8th century B.C. by layering unleavened flat bread with chopped nuts in between, drenching it in honey and then baking it in primitive wood-burning ovens. The modern day baklava went through a number of transitions as the history of the area kept on changing. The Middle Easterns, Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans, Caucasia; Turks, Arabs, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Bulgarians of today who introduce baklava as their national dessert were all part of the Ottoman empire once before.

### Science

Paneer manufacture involves the coagulation of milk proteins to form curd. During this process large clumps of proteins are formed in which fat and other colloidal and dissolved solids get entrapped. The coagulation of milk occurs when pH of milk reaches 4.6 which is the isoelectric point of its major protein, casein. The type and concentration of the acid and the mode of delivery into the hot milk influence the moisture level and product yield. As mentioned before, many different types of coagulants can be used; they may include lemon juice, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, or fermented milk.

On the other hand, the primary scientific portion of baklava revolves around its filo dough structure. Filo dough is usually made with flour, water, salt, egg, and sometimes vinegar, though its ingredients show some variation. Preparing this dough depends on the development of gluten from the proteins in flour. Thus the dough is mixed and kneaded until it’s pliable and silky. The acids in vinegar also help increase the flexibility of gluten so the dough stretches more easily.

## Recipe and Directions

### Paneer

- 150 grams greek yogurt or thick yogurt (1/2 cup + 1-2 tablespoons)
- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
- 2 tablespoons mustard oil 30 ml, or use oil of choice
- 2 teaspoons coriander powder
- 1 teaspoon chaat masala
- 1 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder

- 1/4 teaspoon red chili powder or adjust to taste
- 1 teaspoon kasuri methi crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
- 1 lemon juice of
- 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
- 2 tablespoons chopped mint
- 300 grams paneer cut into big cubes, around 2 heaping cups of cubes paneer
- 1 large onion cut into 1 inch cubes
- 1 large bell pepper cut into 1 inch cubes, I used mix of red and green peppers

1. Whisk the yogurt in a large bowl until smooth. I have used greek yogurt here, you can use regular yogurt just make sure to strain it for several hours until you have thick yogurt left and then use in the recipe.
2. Add all the ingredients for marinade to the yogurt- ginger garlic paste, mustard oil, coriander powder, chaat masala, kashmiri red chili powder, garam masala, red chili powder, kasuri methi and salt.
3. Whisk to combine everything together. Add in juice of 1 lemon along with chopped cilantro and mint. Mix well.
4. Stir in the paneer cubes, onion and bell peppers.
5. Mix until all the paneer pieces and veggies are well coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for minimum for 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Overnight also works!
6. After 1-2 hours, take the marinated paneer and veggies out of the refrigerator. Take a skewer and arrange paneer, onion and peppers on a skewer, alternating with each other.
7. Make all skewers similarly. Meanwhile pre-heat oven to 450 F degrees. Make sure you pre-heat the oven for good 15-20 minutes.
8. Arrange all the prepared skewers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spray the tikka with a oil spray. This is important so that the veggies don’t dry out.
9. Bake at 450 F degrees for 10 minutes and then turn on the broil. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes until paneer pieces look little charred.
10. Remove from oven, squeeze lemon juice, sprinkle chaat masala and serve with cilantro mint chutney.

### Baklava

- 1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
- 1 pound chopped nuts 
- 1 cup butter
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup honey

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9×13 inch pan.
2. Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2 – 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 – 8 sheets deep.
3. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows the make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
4. Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.
