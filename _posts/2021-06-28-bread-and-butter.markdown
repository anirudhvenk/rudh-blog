Bread has been the mainstay of people's diets for much of history. In fact, bread is so basic that historians can compare the purchasing power of daily pay to the price of a pound of bread to determine the relative value of salaries in different centuries. Adding fat to the bread in the form of lard, butter, or oil moistens the bread and combines fat and carbohydrates to bolster energy and nutrition. This creation has been known as "bread and butter" for the past 1000 years.

A fantastic (and slightly exaggerated) myth regarding the inception of this meal is actually creditted to Nicolas Copernicus! (the scientist who theorized that the planets circle around the sun in the early 16th century)

A young Copernicus noticed that the elderly men who had been left to watch the castle during a plague outbreak in modern-day Poland frequently dropped bread on the ground when they carried it up the steep steps from the kitchen. Copernicus separated the citizens into groups and gave each one a different food, suspecting that this could model the disease's spread.

The only group that was plague-free was the one that refused to eat bread. However, completely avoiding bread was not an option. Someone thought that a little smear of churned cream on the black loaves would make it easier to identify when they had been dropped. The epidemic was eradicated at the castle once Copernicus implemented the plan.

## Science behind bread making

The science behind bread-making is a simple but precise art. You're working with a lot of unseen chemicals, despite the fact that there are only four ingredients in the mix. Flour contains the two protiens glutenin and gliadin and many other carbohydrates, either in the form of simple sugars like glucose or in the form of long chains known as starches.

As long as the chemicals are dry, they stay in a non-reactive state. When you add water, though, something unexpected happens: the chemicals begin to combine and react, forming thousands of new compounds. The yeast is reactivated by the water, which causes them to begin chewing on starches and excreting additional sugars, carbon dioxide, and alcohols.

## Science behind butter making

Cream is used to start the butter-making process. Cream is a dairy product prepared from the fattier layer of milk that is skimmed before homogenization. Unhomogenized milk's fat floats to the top, generating a fat-rich layer that is collected to make cream.

When the fat molecules in fresh cream are shaken, they cluster together. Butter is formed when the clumped fat molecules separate from the liquid. Buttermilk is the liquid that remains after shaking.

## Conclusions

The term "bread and butter" has now become such a widely used idiom, all because a young boy wanted to find out what caused sickness in his castle. For fun, let's look at the bread and butter of programming!

Here are four different languages, and each way to write to print `Hello, World!` to the console.

#### C
```c
#include 
 
int main(void)
{
    puts("Hello, world!");
}
```

#### Python
```python
print "Hello, world!"
```

#### Javascript
```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

#### Java
```java
public class HelloWold {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

<br>
Now, here is the shortest way to write a infinite loop in each of the same languages above! ðŸ™‚

#### C
```c
main(){main();}
```

#### Python
```python
while 1:0
```

#### Javascript
```js
for(;;);
```

#### Java
```java
public class A{
    public static void main(String[]a){
        for(;;);
    }
}
```
