Regarded as one of the most simple, delicious, and versatile American baked dishes, the history of the chocolate brownie is actually quite straightforward, only appearing in the United States early 20th century. All pieces of evidence point to a baker named Fanny Farmer, who in 1905, adapted her chocolate chip cookie recipe to a bar cookie baked in a rectangular pan.

However, there are many different legends surrounding the origin of the brownie, told in various ways (a chef added melted chocolate to a batch of biscuits… a cook was baking a cake but didn’t have enough flour). The favorite myth tells of a housewife who was tasked with baking a chocolate cake, but forgot to add the baking powder. Since her cake did not end up rising, she cut up and served the flat pieces.

The science behind brownies is fascinating as well, as the fats and flour end up combining with each other very well in order to create the rich texture brownies are known for. First, the fats and other wet ingredients are mixed together in order to incorporate them evenly throughout the brownie. Then, because of the high fat content, the wet ingredients mix well with the flour and do not create lumps (unlike pancake or waffle batter), since the fat particles easily coat the flour particles.

There are thousands of recipes to make various types of brownies, ranging from soft, cake-like brownies to chewy and fudgy brownies. This recipe creates a quite thick batter, which will make the brownie much more chewy and fudgy when warm.

## Recipe and Directions

- 1½ cups granulated sugar
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy
- ½ cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy
- ½ cup dark chocolate chips
- ¾ teaspoons sea salt
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons water
- ½ teaspoon vanilla

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8×8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray 2.the parchment paper.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
5. Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it’ll be thick – that’s ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 42 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it’s better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!
