### History

Generally speaking, pies evolved as a means of cooking and preserving meat in a number of historical societies and peoples. The Egyptians produced the first pie designs, which consisted of a circular layer of pastry with honey inside, and copies of this were discovered in the tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses II, who ruled from 1304 to 1237 BC. A recipe for chicken pie was also written on a tablet in Sumer, the ancient civilization in what was then Mesopotamia, sometime before 2000 BC.

However, pies began to develop and diverge around the time of the Middle Ages, resulting in unique dishes such as the Cornish Pasty. Parallel to the production of cookware, the evolution of pies continued. The construction of pies changed as reusable earthenware pots were created, and the “pot pie” was born, with a simple pastry lid over a traditionally meat-based filling.

The Pilgrim fathers and early settlers brought their pie recipes to America, adapting them to the ingredients and techniques available in the New World. The American pie continued to adapt over time as various other colonial groups arrived. The Pennsylvania Dutch brought with them a more aromatic, spiced, and less-sweet style of pie-making; while the French brought the approach of making pie with butter and a range of tart, galette and pâté recipes. Swedish immigrants in the States brought recipes for fish pies and berry pies, and Finnish immigrants brought their recipes for pasties and meat pies. It has not evolved much since, and these final prototypes most closely resemble the pies we have today.

### Science

Pie crust is nothing more than flour, fat, and liquid at its most fundamental level. But, if that’s all there is to it, why is hand-making pie crust so famously difficult?

Flour is used to add strength, structure, and elasticity to baked goods. It’s the binder that keeps everything together and, overall makes the pastry a pastry. Standard all-purpose flour is preferred to cake or pastry flour for pie crusts because we want some gluten production for structure but not too much. Furthermore, since mechanical action produces gluten, it’s critical not to over-knead the dough.

In the pie crust, you can use butter, vegetable shortening, lard, or even oil, all of which have different effects. The most flavor and a wonderful melting consistency in the mouth come from butter, but it does not make the most tender pastry. Shortening and lard make a tender cake, but their taste isn’t always suitable for a sweet pie. Also, if the fat is left in large pieces, the crust will be more flaky. If it’s incorporated into the flower more thoroughly, the crust will be tender and crumbly.

The liquid in a pie crust produces steam, which raises the pastry and causes flakes to form. It’s also absorbed into the flour, which aids in the formation of gluten. If you use too little liquid, the dough will not stay together, and if you use too much, you’ll end up with a rock-hard crust.

## Recipe and Directions

### Pie Crust

- 2 1/2 cups (12.5 ounces; 350 grams) all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons (25 grams) sugar
- 1 teaspoon (5 grams) kosher salt
- 2 1/2 sticks (10 ounces; 280 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pats
- 6 tablespoons (3 ounces; 85 milliliters) cold water

1. Combine two thirds of flour with sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse twice to incorporate. Spread butter chunks evenly over the surface. Pulse until no dry flour remains and dough just begins to collect in clumps, about 25 short pulses. Use a rubber spatula to spread the dough evenly around the bowl of the food processor. Sprinkle with remaining flour and pulse until the dough is just barely broken up, about 5 short pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.
2. Sprinkle with water then using a rubber spatula, fold and press dough until it comes together into a ball. Divide the ball in half. Form each half into a 4-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling and baking.

### Pie Filling

- ¾ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 4 cups fresh blueberries

1. Mix sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cinnamon, and sprinkle over blueberries.
2. Line pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust, and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2 – 3/4 inch wide strips, and make lattice top. Crimp and flute edges.
3. Bake pie on lower shelf of oven for about 50 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.
